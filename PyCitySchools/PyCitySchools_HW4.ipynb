    "- When Data is analysed based on Average Math and Reading Scores and percentages of students passing Math, Reading and Overall it can be noticed that Charter schools have significantly better mean scores and higher mean percentages of students passing Overall. If we look at top performing schools they are Charter Schools and the Bottom performing schools are all District Schools. We can say that students in Charter Schools perform better than students in District Schools.  \n",

    "- It can also be noticed that when scores and rate of passing subjects & overall is viewed according to school size and budget per student there is visable/clear trend. This indicates the size of school and amount of budget allocated per student does not really determine students'/school's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However what I noticed is that each school has its own trend in each grade level. Every school has similar performance per subject for all grades (9th to 12th). For instance if we look at reading scores for Baily High School, all grades have a mean score falling within the range of (81% +/- 0.5%) same for Cabera High School (84% +/- 0.5%).\n",

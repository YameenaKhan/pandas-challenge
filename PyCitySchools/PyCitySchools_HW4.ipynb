    "- When Data is analysed based on Average Math and Reading Scores and percentages of students passing Math, Reading and Overall it can be noticed that Charter schools have significantly better mean scores and higher mean percentages of students passing Overall. If we look at top performing schools they are Charter Schools and the Bottom performing schools are all District Schools. We can say that students in Charter Schools perform better than students in District Schools.  \n",

This indicates the size of school and amount of budget allocated per student does not really determine students'/school's performance. Infact the the bottom performing schools have significantly higher budgets than the high performing schools.\n",

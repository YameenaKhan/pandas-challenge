This repository contains solution to Assignment 4 

Inside the folder: PyCitySchools there is a folder called Resources which contains the CSV files on which analysis has been run. PyCitySchools also contains my Jupyter notebook which contains the tables and my analysis.

High-Level Analysis of the PyCitySchools: (Analysis in much more detail in the Jupyter Notebook)
- Charter Schools have a better performance compared to district schools
- Amount of budget allocated per school or per student does not determine or influence the performance of a school.
-  Each school performance in subjects is similar for all grade levels meaning e.g for Baily High School if we look at reading scores for all grades mean score falls within range of 81% +/- 0.5%, so on so forth for other schools
